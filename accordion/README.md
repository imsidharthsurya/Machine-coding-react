# Accordion Component

## Overview
The Accordion component allows users to expand and collapse sections of content. It's a common UI pattern used to organize information and improve readability.

## Features
- Multiple or single section expansion
- Smooth transitions
- Customizable headings and content

## Approach
1. **State Management:** Each accordion section's open/closed state is managed in React state.
2. **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes for screen readers.
3. **Reusability:** Accepts data via props for dynamic content.

## Usage
```jsx
<Accordion sections={[{title: 'Section 1', content: 'Details...'}]} />
```

## File Structure
- `Accordion.js` : Main component logic
- `Accordion.css` : Styling
